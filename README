C# NumberExtensions

Adds a few useful extension methods to the standard number classes.

BitCount: Counts the number of bits set in an integer.

ReverseBits: Reverses the bits in an integer.

IsPowerOf2: Returns true if the integer or floating-point number is a power of 2.

Log2Floor: Returns the floor of the base 2 logarithm of the integer or floating-point number. Faster than Math.Floor(Math.Log2(n)).

Log2Ceiling: Returns the ceiling of the base 2 logarithm of the integer or floating-point number. Faster than Math.Ceiling(Math.Log2(n)).

ModMul: Multiplies two integers and takes the modulus of the result.

ModPow: Raises an integer to a power and takes the modulus of the result.
